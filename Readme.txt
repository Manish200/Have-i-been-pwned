  This project is similar as this site https://haveibeenpwned.com/.
  I have requested api from that site for doing this project. This    project helps in checking if you have an account that has been      compromised in a data breach. Like your email address etc.


  In this project i have created a local node server which is named
  as index.js . 

   # Running and installing.
  
     ## First You have nodeJs installed on your PC.

  -> First of all clone this project.
  -> Second open the terminal and in the same directory as your      project and write -  npm init
  -> Now hit enter for different informations like 
       -> package name
       -> version
       -> description
       -> git repo
       -> keyword
       -> author
       -> license
   -> Now you will se a json file created, it is asking Is this ok?       (yes). Hit enter.
   -> Now its time for installing node modules. Write on terminal - 
       -> npm install express --save
       -> npm install cors --save
       -> npm install request --save
   -> Now run the server with the command - 
       -> node index.js

   -> Now the server is started and then just open the index.html         file and check if you have an account that has been                 compromised in a data breach or not.
